A JavaScript port of the original Jump 'n Bump game.

Play the classic Jump 'n Bump game directly in your browser! Choose from 200+ levels, customize game options, and enjoy the original multiplayer bunny action with friends around one keyboard.

Jump 'n Bump was originally a DOS game by Brainchild Design, which was open sourced under the GPL license and ported to SDL, and then SDL2, and now JavaScript!

## Controls

The controls are keyboard layout-independent, which means that regardless of
the layout that you are using (e.g. AZERTY or Dvorak), they are located as if
it were QWERTY.

The controls on a **QWERTY** keyboard are:

- A, W, D to steer Dot
- ‚Üê, ‚Üë, ‚Üí to steer Jiffy
- J, I, L to steer Fizz
- 4, 8, 6 to steer Mijji (on the numeric pad)

- ? (SHIFT + /) toggles the shortcut overlay
- F (SHIFT + f) toggles fullscreen
- ESC ends the current game. When pressed from the menu screen it will exit to the Web UI landing page.

## Extra levels

Additional levels can be loaded from the Web UI `Change level` button.

You can also play any valid `.dat` level file from your computer. Select the `Load Custom Level` button and choose the file from your Computer.
