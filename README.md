This is a game for the whole family. You play cute fluffy little bunnies and
hop on each other's heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to let each active player
jump over the tree trunk to enter the play area, and then walk to the right.
You will then enter the arena. The aim is to jump on the other bunnies' heads‚Ä¶

Jump 'n Bump was originally a DOS game by Brainchild Design, which was open
sourced under the GPL license and ported to SDL, and then SDL2, and now JavaScript!

## Controls

The controls are keyboard layout-independent, which means that regardless of
the layout that you are using (e.g. AZERTY or Dvorak), they are located as if
it were QWERTY.

The controls on a **QWERTY** keyboard are:

- A, W, D to steer Dot
- ‚Üê, ‚Üë, ‚Üí to steer Jiffy
- J, I, L to steer Fizz
- 4, 8, 6 to steer Mijji (on the numeric pad)

- ? (SHIFT + /) toggles the shortcut overlay
- F (SHIFT + f) toggles fullscreen
- ESC ends the current game. When pressed from the menu screen it will exit to the Web UI landing page.

## Extra levels

Additional levels can be loaded from the Web UI `Change level` button.

You can also play any valid `.dat` level file from your computer. Select the `Load Custom Level` button and choose the file from your Computer.
